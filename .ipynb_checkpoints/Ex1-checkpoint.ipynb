       " 'it made superstars of its young cast, was credited with re-energising the career of winona ryder, and won multiple awards, though its enormous impact seemed almost to take everyone by surprise, including netflix.',\n",
       " 'the power of nostalgia is certainly strong enough to paper over the series’ flaws: though charming and undoubtedly stylish, the first season didn’t quite match up to the might of its opening episode.',\n",
       " 'more sweet than scary, it was carried along by a clever eye for an iconic moment, likable characters and incisive tributes to its cinematic inspirations.',\n",
       " 'stranger things 2, then – its creators, the duffer brothers, have styled the title this way in a nod to the movies it references – asks more of itself and its audience.',\n",
       " 'it is bigger in ambition, bigger in story – and now bigger in budget, thanks to its success.',\n",
       " 'it certainly looks more expensive, though the special effects are never desperately showy, and its child stars are given emotional storylines demanding greater depth, to which some step up – noah schnapp as the long-suffering will is extraordinary – and some just about manage.',\n",
       " 'the action isn’t only confined to hawkins, indiana, and we’re introduced to several new characters in an attempt to broaden the show’s scope.',\n",
       " 'it’s impossible to discuss the plot in much detail – another sign of its success is that episodes were released early only to reviewers who agreed not to mention a list of proscribed storylines, which turn out to be the bulk of the series.',\n",

       " 'it’s only when the final four instalments start to tear into the action that you realise quite how slow the rest of it has been; there’s a standalone episode that takes place in another location that puts a criminal dent in the pace by taking us away from the central gang at a crucial moment.',\n",
       " 'some of the additions to the cast, too, fall wide of the mark.',\n",
       " 'there’s a marauding gang of terrorist-punks who are more fashion-mag shoot than public menace; and billy, a bullying big brother who seems like a composite of every character kiefer sutherland played in the 80s, is even sillier than his hairspray mullet would imply.',\n",
       " 'he doesn’t even have the worst hair on the show.',\n",
       " 'but there’s a lot to admire in what the duffers have achieved.',\n",
       " 'it’s a gorgeous piece of television, in which everything from will’s stormy-night visions of the upside down to a simple shot of new girl max skateboarding looks meticulously considered.',\n",
       " 'there will be plenty of spot-the-reference moments for sci-fi and horror fans, particularly as it all starts to go wrong in the lab and the series progresses towards a darker, more perilous climax.',\n",

       " 'max is the street-smart new member of the club (though her pejorative use of the word “stalker” seems rather modern for 1984).',\n",
       " 'nancy is less simpering and more crucial, and eleven is off on her own carrie-ish travels, where she meets more tough girls, though her return from where we left her last season is wrapped up a little too neatly.',\n",
       " 'even winona ryder’s joyce seems more focused on getting the job done this time, though it’s hard not to feel for her house, which once again ends up looking like a blue peter activity gone very badly awry.',\n",
       " 'stranger things can feel as if it straddles two worlds, just as in the show.',\n",
       " 'it’s part retro teen drama, with plenty of adolescent angst, and part gruesome sci-fi horror, with this season in particular ramping up the thrills.',\n",
       " 'sometimes these elements can hit a tonal barrier, in which neither is given space to fully breathe.',\n",
       " 'but compromise, as police chief jim hopper gently explains to eleven, means “kinda halfway happy”.',\n",
