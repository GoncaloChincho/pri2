It’s part retro teen drama, with plenty of adolescent angst, and part gruesome sci-fi horror, with this season in particular ramping up the thrills. 

There will be plenty of spot-the-reference moments for sci-fi and horror fans, particularly as it all starts to go wrong in the lab and the series progresses towards a darker, more perilous climax.

It’s a gorgeous piece of television, in which everything from Will’s stormy-night visions of the Upside Down to a simple shot of new girl Max skateboarding looks meticulously considered. 

There is a weight of expectation on the shoulder pads of Stranger Things 2, the follow-up series to Netflix’s revival of, and homage to, the adventurous spirit of 1980s films like The Goonies, Stand By Me and ET.

Stranger Things 2, then – its creators, the Duffer Brothers, have styled the title this way in a nod to the movies it references – asks more of itself and its audience.
